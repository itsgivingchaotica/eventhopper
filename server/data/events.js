    description: "A viral breakout of the internet and social-media age, Slayyyter has won millions of fans who gravitate toward her party-ready art-pop bangers that draw inspiration from Charli XCX, Paris Hilton, Lady Gaga, and more. Describing why she finds songwriting to be therapeutic, Slayyyter told Paper Magazine in November 2021: \"When you're really feeling strongly about something or someone or something that's happened to you, it's the best way to get it out. The best therapy for it is to write a song about it. I hate the idea of certain songwriting topics being off limits... that is so stupid. Everything about songwriting and what makes music so powerful is that it's your real experiences that maybe someone else might connect to.\"",
